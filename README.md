# ![extension-icon](icons/copy-selected-tab-info-ICON-64x64.png) Copy Tab Info

This Firefox extension allows you to copy the URLs and titles of the currently selected tabs to clipboard. The only difference from upstream is that the default action when pressing the extension icon is to copy the URL, rather than some random text and then the URL.

Copying a URL is an action I do many times a day. Copying a tab's title is a novelty thing I might want to someday do, probably in markdown anyway. This makes the most common action the default one, a principle many software writers can't wrap their heads around for some reason.

## Installation
The old add-on can be installed through the [Firefox Add-On Gallery](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/copy-selected-tab-info/).

## Usage
1. Select tabs in the tab bar.
2. Right click anywhere on the tab bar and hover over the "Copy Select Tab Info" context menu entry
3. Select among the available formats for copying the URLs and titles of the selected links.

Alternatively:
1. Select tabs in the tab bar.
2. Click on the 'Copy Selected Tab Info' toolbar button created by this extension to copy
the URL(s) of the selected tab(s).
